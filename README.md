README
======

This is an online board game modeled after the popular Settlers of Catan. This project is A_WORK_IN_PTOGRESS.

Dependencies
============

*Server: node.js
*Client: any web browser

Planning and Fies
=================

Currently, the biggest hassle is that javascript libraries are being tracked by this git repository. In the future, it would be nice to have these projects as submodules but then they might need other dependencies to compile, and that just adds to the hassle. So for the time being, these are being tracked to reduce loading time during testing.
